          Compared to other hues, blue is less frequent in minerals and
          crystals.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Due to the rarity of minerals and crystals possessing the necessary
            chemical and structural makeup to generate blue, blue is less
            prevalent in minerals and crystals than other hues.
          </li>
          <li>
            The color that minerals and crystals show is frequently influenced
            by the particular chemical makeup and the arrangement of the atoms
            in the crystal structure. Minerals and crystals are made up of a
            variety of elements and compounds. Different kinds of electron
            transitions and light wave absorption result in various hues. A
            certain set of circumstances, such as a particular kind of crystal
            structure and the presence of particular elements or impurities, are
            required to generate the color blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simply put, minerals and crystals are like puzzle pieces: in order
            to create a specific hue, in this case blue, the right shape and
            quantity of pieces are required. Because they do not require the
            same circumstances as blue, other hues like red, yellow, and green
            are more widespread and simpler to create.
          </li>
          <li>
            To be more specific, blue structural coloration in minerals and
            crystals requires the presence of particular elements, a precise
            arrangement of atoms, and a specified size and form of the crystal.
            For instance, the mineral lazurite is well known for its intense
            blue hue, which is brought on by the presence of sulfur and titanium
            atoms organized in a certain pattern. Similar to how blue sapphires
            get their color from titanium and iron atoms in a particular crystal
            structure, Blue minerals and crystals are more abundant because of
            the specific circumstances needed for these structural colorations
            to emerge. rare.
